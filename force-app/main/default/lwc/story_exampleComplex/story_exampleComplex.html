        Scene selector allows us to choose from the list of all scenes.
        Note that it dispatches a 'scene' event
        where the event.detail is the new scene chosen.
        @dispatch {CustomEvent='scene'}

    <!--
        From the storybook side, we don't care, we just bind to the current scene.

        Note, we want to include the following, so we don't get null errors
        when it first loads:
        if:true={currentScene}

        note the large width is based on the Lightning Design System width
        @see https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/utilities/sizing/

        the sandbox-styles also allow for specifying exactly the styles of the sandbox
        so we can see how our component fits within a container of 800px
        or 800x400 or 200x200, or with a border, with padding, etc.

            This will be placed inside the 'sandbox' of the story
